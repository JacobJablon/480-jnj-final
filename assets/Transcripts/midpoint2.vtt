Civic leaders and grassroots organizations played a major role

00:03.120 --> 00:08.080
in revitalizing the city. Downtown Rochester saw new investments in housing,

00:08.080 --> 00:11.200
restaurants, art spaces, and green infrastructure.

00:11.200 --> 00:15.840
Empty factories were repurposed into housing, galleries, and new office spaces.

00:15.840 --> 00:19.200
Cultural institutions such as the Strong Museum of Play and the Rochester

00:19.200 --> 00:22.960
Philharmonic helped re-energize the arts and tourism scenes.

00:22.960 --> 00:26.800
Importantly, the community began focusing more on inclusion and equity,

00:26.800 --> 00:30.560
recognizing that the old industrial model had often left behind marginalized

00:30.560 --> 00:34.480
communities, the city launched initiatives to promote workforce development,

00:34.480 --> 00:37.360
access to education, and affordable housing.

00:37.360 --> 00:41.360
Efforts to bridge the digital divide support minority-owned businesses

00:41.360 --> 00:45.040
and reinvest and underserved neighborhoods have been part of Rochester's broader efforts

00:45.040 --> 00:49.920
to ensure that its resurgence benefits all residents, not just a privileged few.
