00:00.000 --> 00:05.600
In many ways Rochester was forced to rediscover who it was without its corporate titans.

00:05.600 --> 00:10.600
The process was difficult marked by uncertainty and big losses, but over the next two decades

00:10.600 --> 00:17.240
Rochester would undergo a remarkable transformation rooted in innovation, education, and community

00:17.240 --> 00:19.320
resilience.

00:19.320 --> 00:23.520
One of the first pillars of Rochester's comeback was its institutions.

00:23.520 --> 00:28.800
U of R and RIT stepped into leadership roles, not just as educators, but as engines of

00:28.800 --> 00:31.920
research, innovation, and job creation.

00:31.920 --> 00:36.520
The U of R Medical Center grew into one of the largest employers in the region, driving

00:36.520 --> 00:39.880
advancements in healthcare and biomedical research.

00:39.880 --> 00:45.720
Meanwhile, RIT's strong programs in engineering, computer science, and the arts attracted talent

00:45.720 --> 00:50.880
from across the country and played a crucial role in developing Rochester's new future.

00:50.880 --> 00:55.720
Rather than linger on its past, the city began to leverage its innovative roots.

00:55.720 --> 01:00.800
Rochester's legacy in optics, imaging, and manufacturing became the foundation for a growing

01:00.800 --> 01:05.400
tech movement and a vibrant startup culture began to take form.

01:05.400 --> 01:09.680
Former engineers from Kodak and Xerox, as well as new graduates, began launching companies

01:09.680 --> 01:11.360
of their own.

01:11.360 --> 01:16.200
With help from local incubators and entrepreneurship programs, Rochester started to see the rise

01:16.200 --> 01:20.840
of small businesses such as the two on this tour, ITX and Envative.

01:20.840 --> 01:25.200
This new generation helped shift the city's economy from being reliant on a few large employers

01:25.200 --> 01:27.320
to one driven by innovation and diversity.
