00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
If you look out over the water, you can see one of Rochester's most recognizable buildings

00:04.000 --> 00:09.360
in the distance, Kodak headquarters. This is the company most often associated with Rochester,

00:09.360 --> 00:13.600
and it's because of Kodak that Rochester has been coined the imaging capital of the world.

00:14.400 --> 00:20.000
George Eastman, Kodak's founder, introduced the Kodak camera in 1888, revolutionizing the way

00:20.000 --> 00:25.600
people took photos. People could now take a picture by simply pressing a button, a simplistic idea

00:25.600 --> 00:30.480
Kodak used in their early marketing with the slogan, you push the button, we do the rest.

00:31.760 --> 00:36.400
Kodak's rise to prominence was largely driven by their effective use of advertising and their

00:36.400 --> 00:42.240
groundbreaking ability to simplify photography. They transformed a task once reserved for professionals

00:42.240 --> 00:47.280
into something accessible to the average person. Kodak failed to fully embrace the potential of

00:47.280 --> 00:53.120
digital cameras, which led to them losing hold of their dominant market share, just like Xerox
   
00:53.120 --> 00:59.040
and Baush and Lomb. The big three couldn't keep up with the technological advancements that were

00:59.040 --> 01:04.000
happening in the world as they were slow to realize the new potential of digital technology in

01:04.000 --> 01:10.560
photographic sciences and failed to invest in its innovation. As time went on, the same consumers who

01:10.560 --> 01:15.120
hailed these companies for their genius inventions moved to new technology from other companies.

01:15.760 --> 01:20.320
The companies began major layoffs and soon there were tens of thousands of unemployed workers

01:20.320 --> 01:21.920
within the Rochester community.
