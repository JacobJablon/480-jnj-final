00:00.000 --> 00:04.580
In its past, with Kodak, Xerox, and Baush, and Lomb, Rochester flourished, and now it's

00:04.580 --> 00:06.980
on the way to reaching that height once again.

00:06.980 --> 00:10.780
This city stands as a story of resilience and reinvention.

00:10.780 --> 00:16.460
It's no longer defined by the logos of industrial giants, but by its people, educators, creators,

00:16.460 --> 00:22.340
engineers, artists, and activists, who chose to stay, rebuild, and reshape their community

00:22.340 --> 00:24.260
for the future.

00:24.260 --> 00:28.820
Although this walk has now come to an end, Rochester's new journey is just starting.

00:28.820 --> 00:32.320
We want to say thank you for tuning into our experience and for touring through the

00:32.320 --> 00:35.720
community with the eyes of a viewer and a learner.
