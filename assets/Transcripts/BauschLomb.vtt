Ah, Bausch and Lomb, the second of the big three that have revolutionized the optical sciences impacting the flower city.

00:07.620 --> 00:13.940
Who would have thought that it would all start with two guys opening an optical goods store in Rochester NY?

00:13.940 --> 00:19.340
Both JJ Bausch and Henry Lomb were able to revolutionize Vulcanite eyeglass frames,

00:19.340 --> 00:25.860
transitioning into microscope production, leading all the way to mass producing contact lenses for the general public.

00:26.120 --> 00:33.120
Would you believe me if I told you that the first photos of the moon were taken using Bouch and Lomb's Super Balter Lenses?

00:33.120 --> 00:40.000
Bausch and Lomb was also responsible for creating the Cinemoscope lens, which made the first few films premiered in movie theaters,

00:40.000 --> 00:47.160
which brought in widescreen movie projection to the big screen, just like with Xerox and Kodak Bausch and Lomb was in a development ahead of its time.

00:47.160 --> 00:59.160
But just like its siblings Bouch and Lomb faced issues that required them to lay off at least 10% of their workforce between 2000 to 2001 and revenue going flat due to the lack of discipline costs.
