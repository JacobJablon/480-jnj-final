00:00.000 --> 00:03.840
The downfall of the Big Three had a major impact on the Rochester community.

00:03.840 --> 00:06.720
The loss of income and benefits created a ripple effect,

00:06.720 --> 00:12.560
straining local schools, hospitals, and social services that had long relied on corporate sponsorship.

00:12.560 --> 00:17.280
As employment opportunities dried up, the city's population began to decline.

00:17.280 --> 00:21.680
Young adults, once attracted to the stability and opportunity offered by Rochester's major

00:21.680 --> 00:24.640
employers, began to leave in search of work elsewhere.

00:24.720 --> 00:28.960
Loss of talent became a serious concern, particularly as newly graduated engineers,

00:28.960 --> 00:33.280
designers, and business minds from local institutions like the University of Rochester,

00:33.280 --> 00:38.480
U of R, and Rochester Institute of Technology, RIT, found few reasons to stay.

00:39.120 --> 00:43.920
Entire neighborhoods, particularly those near-old factories and offices, began to decline.

00:44.720 --> 00:49.120
Commercial districts that had once thrived with foot traffic were now filled with empty stores

00:49.120 --> 00:54.240
and boarded up buildings. Downtown Rochester, once vibrant with bustling crowds,

00:54.240 --> 01:00.240
grew quiet. This visible decline left a lasting impact on the community's morale and identity.

01:00.960 --> 01:06.000
Perhaps most significantly, Rochester's identity as a company town began to crumble.
