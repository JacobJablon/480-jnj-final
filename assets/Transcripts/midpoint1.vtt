00:00.000 --> 00:02.160
For decades, their logos were everywhere,

00:02.160 --> 00:05.120
from local arenas to museums and concert halls.

00:05.120 --> 00:07.440
Kodak, Xerox, and Baush and Lomb

00:07.440 --> 00:10.160
were integrated into the core of the city.

00:10.160 --> 00:12.720
Their executives played key roles on civic boards,

00:12.720 --> 00:15.000
helping to shape local policies and initiatives

00:15.000 --> 00:18.440
and other employees contributed at the grassroots level.

00:18.440 --> 00:20.200
When these companies retreated,

00:20.200 --> 00:22.240
it created not only an economic vacuum,

00:22.240 --> 00:24.160
but also a cultural one.

00:24.160 --> 00:26.040
Beyond the office walls, these companies

00:26.040 --> 00:28.840
had long supported local culture and philanthropy.

00:28.880 --> 00:30.200
So when their pockets dried up,

00:30.200 --> 00:32.480
there was a noticeable void.

00:32.480 --> 00:35.400
Cultural institutions like the Rochester Philharmonic,

00:35.400 --> 00:37.760
the George Eastman Museum, and local galleries

00:37.760 --> 00:39.960
suddenly had to make do with less.

00:39.960 --> 00:41.760
Some scaled back while others scrambled

00:41.760 --> 00:43.640
for new sources of funding.

00:43.640 --> 00:45.760
This led to fewer exhibits, performances,

00:45.760 --> 00:49.480
and opportunities for local artists to showcase their work.

00:49.480 --> 00:51.760
For decades, many people in the Rochester area

00:51.760 --> 00:53.520
followed a similar path.

00:53.520 --> 00:55.640
Graduate high school or college get hired

00:55.640 --> 00:57.920
by one of the big three, work there for life,

00:57.960 --> 01:00.360
and retire with a good pension.

01:00.360 --> 01:02.240
When these job paths collapsed,

01:02.240 --> 01:03.800
many started to question the idea

01:03.800 --> 01:06.400
of corporate loyalty altogether.

01:06.400 --> 01:09.440
Work became more about adaptability than security.

01:09.440 --> 01:11.120
People began changing careers,

01:11.120 --> 01:12.360
starting their own businesses,

01:12.360 --> 01:14.960
and even leaving the city entirely.

01:14.960 --> 01:16.240
The community shifted around,

01:16.240 --> 01:18.200
and in some ways became unstable,

01:18.200 --> 01:20.320
but also more open to reinvention.
