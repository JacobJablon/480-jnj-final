Rochester, the city of imagination and innovation through the optical lenses of a photographic display,

00:05.920 --> 00:09.200
a city that has been curated to be the world's imaging center,

00:09.200 --> 00:13.040
down thanks to the involvement of three major companies that originate from the area,

00:13.040 --> 00:15.440
Xerox, Kodak, and Baushan Lom.

00:15.440 --> 00:18.320
These companies have been labeled as the big three,

00:18.320 --> 00:22.080
as they paved the way for innovation in optical and photographic sciences

00:22.080 --> 00:25.280
and inserted the foundations of future technological developments.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.680
Although much time has passed,

00:27.760 --> 00:31.600
since these companies have been established, even in current times,

00:31.600 --> 00:34.960
they still hold an unforgettable presence in the flower city.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.800
Welcome to Xerox Tower, or what is left of Xerox.

00:39.520 --> 00:43.760
What was once a company that stood on top of the world in office technology has been

00:43.760 --> 00:48.400
demolished and rebranded as a multi-floor university housing complex for college students

00:48.400 --> 00:49.920
known as Innovation Square.

00:50.560 --> 00:55.360
This is where the community rose, and Xerox fell. Xerox had watered its soil when

00:55.360 --> 00:59.680
Chester Carlson, the inventor of Zerography, a dry photocopying technique,

00:59.680 --> 01:02.240
sought an opportunity to feature his discovery,

01:02.240 --> 01:05.040
taking ten years to fulfill before hitting the jackpot.

01:05.760 --> 01:08.720
He finally found his big break when he was hired by a small

01:08.720 --> 01:12.480
photo-paper-making company in Rochester called Hayloid Company.

01:12.480 --> 01:17.440
They took interest in his research and later transformed into the company we all know as Xerox

01:17.440 --> 01:21.760
Corporation. Following Xerox's rise in photographic sciences,

01:21.760 --> 01:25.520
they had started to gain competition and what would end up being a personal computer

01:25.520 --> 01:30.560
uproar in the following years. Other companies were starting to create their own personal

01:30.560 --> 01:34.240
computers and were making greater profits than Xerox had anticipated.

01:35.040 --> 01:39.760
Not wanting to fall behind in the expansion race, Xerox decided to take matters into their

01:39.760 --> 01:43.280
own hands and create its own computer, the Xerox Alto.

01:44.240 --> 01:47.920
It said that this computer inspired the first set of desktop computers,

01:47.920 --> 01:52.320
such as the Macintosh, to be created, but this computer specifically failed to meet the

01:52.320 --> 01:58.560
demands of society's wants. Xerox flew too close to the sun and started to see a decrease in

01:58.560 --> 02:04.320
sales numbers, period by period. As time went on, they started to let off multiple workers.

02:04.320 --> 02:08.720
What you see now is the result of Xerox losing its footing in Rochester.

02:08.720 --> 02:13.280
If you look closely, you can still see the indication of where the company's logo used to be

02:13.280 --> 02:15.040
as if it were etched out of history.
